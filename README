radeonhd is the X.org X11 driver for AMD GPG (ATI) r5xx/r6xx chipsets.

More detailed notes about

Installation
============

With X.Org 7.0 and later:

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make
   $ make install

This will litter all kinds of compiled files throughout your source tree.

With X.Org prior to 7.0:

   $ xmkmf -a
   $ make EXTRA_INCLUDES="-I/usr/include/xorg" all
   $ make install

This uses imake and is for compatibility with older systems.

To avoid building in your source tree, do:

   $ mkdir _b && cd _b
   $ autogen -vis ..
   $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode
   $ make
   $ make install

Runs the build in _b/ - and if something is completely messed up, you can
safely remove the _b/ directory and create a new one without affecting any
source files.

Hint: If you happen to have multiple branches in your git source tree, you
      can have per-branch _b-BRANCH/ build trees and _i-BRANCH/ install
      trees. ("... configure ... --prefix=$PWD/_i-BRANCH")

Note that none of these methods will install the rhd_conntest tool, but it
will be available as ./utils/conntest/rhd_conntest after the "make" run.



Getting and updating the radeonhd source code
=============================================

radeonhd is maintained in the git repository found at

   git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/driver/xf86-video-radeonhd

You can find information on using git at the git website http://git.or.cz/
and a short intro at
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/Developers

You can get a copy of the repository like this:

   $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/driver/xf86-video-radeonhd
   $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/driver/xf86-video-radeonhd my-radeonhd

This will create a directory xf86-video-radeonhd in the current directory
by default, or the given directoy my-radeonhd otherwise.

If you have not made any local changes and want to update you source code
with the newest stuff from the official radeonhd repository, you can run this:

   $ git pull

If you HAVE made local changes and committed them locally to your master
branch, you will be better off running

   $ git fetch -v
   $ git rebase origin

If you're using more branches, read the git docs.



Feeding back source code
========================

You can easily create patches to send to the developers using git.

   $ vi some_file.c
   $ git status
   $ git diff
   $ git add some_file.c
   $ git commit

   $ git format-patches origin

Then you can sift through the 0*.patch files and choose a few to send to
the radeonhd mailing list.
